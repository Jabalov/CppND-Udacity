# CppND-Udacity

This's a private repo, i used it to draw my solutions together on The C++ Nanodegree Projects provided by Udacity.
There's a simple implementation for The A* algorithm in The A_star file.
The Plenty of Files contain each project's solution, their README files have much information than i can mention right here.
