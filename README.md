# CppND-Udacity

This's a private repo, i used it to draw my solutions together, for The C++ Nanodegree Projects provided by Udacity. <br>
There's a simple implementation for The A* algorithm in The A_star file. <br>
The Plenty of Files contain each project's solution, their README files have much information than i cannot mention right here.
